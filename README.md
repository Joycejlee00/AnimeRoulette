**Dont know what to watch? But have a genre in mind? Anime Roulette is a bot that can help!**

   

AR (Anime Roulette) is a discord bot that makes use of the [Jikan Apiary](https://jikan.docs.apiary.io/#introduction/information).
Jikan Apiary is a wrapper (unofficial) that takes [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/) and turns into more useable API path (rest).

This discord has a list of built-in commands (such as '.Romance') that allows users to get back a random anime (including information), within a specific genre.

   ### Extra

  I created this discord bot using [Discord.Js](https://discord.js.org/#/), which allows me to use the Discord API. Along with Discord.Js, I also used [Node.Js](https://nodejs.org/en/), which is a runtime enginine for Javascript.
            
            
   My boyfriend and love for anime has insprired me to create this discord bot. We always wanted to watch anime but did not know which anime to watch (excluding genre); not only us, but many of my friends also used discord as one of their primary form of communication. This inspired me to create a discord bot that would recommend a random anime depending on the genre.
