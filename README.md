**Dont know what to watch? Use the Anime Roulette bot to decide!**

   

AR (Anime Roulette) is a discord bot that makes use of the [Jikan Apiary](https://jikan.docs.apiary.io/#introduction/information).
Jikan Apiary is a wrapper (unofficial) that takes [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/) and turns into more useable API path (rest).

   ### Extra

  I created this discord bot using [Discord.Js](https://discord.js.org/#/), which allows me to use the Discord API. I also utilized [Node.Js](https://nodejs.org/en/), which is a runtime engine for Javascript.
            
            
   My boyfriend inspired me to create this discord bot. We both use discord very often. There were many times where we would just talk about which anime to watch but never came down to a single answer. This gave me an idea to create a bot that suggests random animes by genre.
