# Anime Roulette
Dont know what to watch? But have a genre in mind?
Anime Roulette is a bot that can help with that!

AR (Anime Roulette) is a discord bot that makes use of the [Jikan Apiary](https://jikan.docs.apiary.io/#introduction/information). Jikan Apiary is a wrapper (unofficial) that takes [MyAnimeList's API](https://myanimelist.net/) and turns into more useable API path.

This discord bot uses Jikan's genre category to get various genres for each command. It has a list of built-in commands (such as '.Romance') that allows users to get back a random anime (including information), within a specific genre.
